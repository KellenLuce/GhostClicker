            "In this May 29, 2018, file photo, Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber speaks during an event to announce the addition of FC Cincinnati as an expansion team in Cincinnati.APNEW!158sharesBy Ryan Clarke | The Oregonian/OregonLiveMLS Commissioner Don Garber on Thursday said “nothing” that came out in the U.S. Soccer investigation indicates that Merritt Paulson should sell the Portland Timbers, and the league “(does) not see any reason at all” for the owner to sell.Paulson recently fired two top executives and stepped down as CEO of the Timbers and Portland Thorns in the wake of the U.S. Soccer investigation, which determined that Paulson and his executives enabled and vouched for former Thorns coach Paul Riley, who is accused of sexual harassment and coercion of multiple former players.“We, at this time, do not see any reason at all for Merritt to sell the Timbers,” Garber said.The commissioner went on to say that Paulson has “publicly acknowledged” his mistakes and that he has “taken responsibility for those decisions that he’s made.” Garber added that stepping down as CEO and firing Gavin Wilkinson and Mike Golub were “steps in the right direction.”“So, there was nothing that came out in the (Yates) report that would have us think any differently from what I just stated there,” Garber said.Garber discussed Paulson and the Timbers on Thursday in Los Angeles, where he delivered his annual “State of the League.” Afterward, the commissioner fielded questions from reporters, who asked about Paulson’s ownership of the Timbers.It was not the first time Garber has defended Paulson. In February, he sidestepped questions about Paulson’s ownership in the wake of domestic violence allegations against former Timbers player Andy Polo.“I have great faith in the Paulson family,” Garber said in February. “Hank Paulson could be the most involved MLS board member, and I have enormous faith and confidence in Merritt Paulson who has built from scratch one of the great sports teams in any sport in our country if not throughout North America. I know he’s very passionate about his team, both the Portland Timbers and the Portland Thorns, and is going to cooperate in anything that is being reviewed.”The U.S. Soccer report later found that the Thorns organization often refused to cooperate with the investigation and actively interfered with it.Read the full U.S. Soccer report here.UPDATE (5:28 p.m.) — The Thorns provided the following statement to The Oregonian/OregonLive:“As of today, the Thorns have produced over 300 documents to investigators totaling over 1,500 pages, and Club representatives have sat for multiple interviews with both investigative teams,” the statement reads. “In fact, all of the Club’s employees that were requested to be interviewed by the investigative teams have sat for those interviews. While it is correct that the Thorns retained certain information on the basis of the attorney-client privilege, the Club provided as much information as feasible without waiving any legal privilege or protections.“In fewer than three months from DLA Piper’s first conversation with the USSF investigators (which occurred as a result of their outreach), the Thorns had produced hundreds of pages of documents including materials that it had to carefully consider in light of legal privileges and protections. The Thorns cooperated and acted expeditiously, despite that (as the Yates Report acknowledges) the Club was under no obligation to do so. The issue of the scope of attorney-client privilege was complicated in this situation by the fact that USSF was contracted to run the NWSL in 2015, the NWSL directly employed the players on the Thorns and the Thorns employed Paul Riley. That construct raised complicated issues of which party owned or could waive the applicable privileges.”-- Ryan Clarke, rclarke@oregonian.com, Twitter: @RyanTClarkeIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.\n",

            "Portland Thorns and Houston Dash players, along with referees, gather at midfield in a demonstration of solidarity to show support for two former NWSL players who came forward with allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against a prominent coach, Paul Riley. Photo by Sean Meagher/Staff.Sean Meagher/The OregonianNEW!1,442sharesBy Ryan Clarke | The Oregonian/OregonLivePortland Thorns and Timbers owner Merritt Paulson knew of alleged non-sexual abuses by former Thorns coach Paul Riley but did not act on the information, and executive Gavin Wilkinson blamed a player who accused Riley of sexual misconduct for “putting Riley in a bad position,” adding that he would “hire (Riley) in a heartbeat.”The revelations are part of a damning account, released Monday by the U.S. Soccer Federation, following a yearlong investigation into alleged misconduct and abuses across the National Women’s Soccer League. The investigation revealed that Paulson and Wilkinson not only enabled, but also vouched for Riley, who was allowed to coach professional women’s soccer from the time he was fired by the Thorns in 2015 until after his alleged misdeeds were exposed in 2021 — even though U.S. Soccer and the NWSL knew details of a 2015 Thorns internal investigation into his termination.The U.S. Soccer investigation, led by former U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates, labeled this an institutional failure on the part of U.S. Soccer and the NWSL, and also determined that Paulson, Wilkinson and the Thorns bear significant responsibility — and even that the Thorns interfered in its investigation.A Thorns spokesperson told The Oregonian/OregonLive that the club will “provide comment upon reading the report later today.”Riley is accused of sexually coercing and harassing players Mana Shim and Sinead Farrelly as coach of the Thorns. He was fired for cause by the Thorns in 2015, and the reasons for his dismissal were not immediately made public.Yates’ investigation found that Paulson knew of other alleged, non-sexual abuses as early as 2014, but did not act on the information. It also found that in a conversation with the Western New York Flash — after Riley and the Thorns parted ways — that Wilkinson blamed Shim for “putting Riley in a bad position” and said that he would “hire (him) in a heartbeat.” Riley was soon hired by the Flash, which later relocated and became the North Carolina Courage.“In 2014, after Riley’s first season as head coach of the Thorns, the NWSL issued an anonymous player survey in which players identified Riley as ‘verbally abusive,’ ‘sexis(t),’ ‘destructive’ and stated he ‘s--- on (the) players every day,’” U.S. Soccer’s report reads. “The survey results were shared with NWSL Executive Director Cheryl Bailey, USSF President Sunil Gulati and (CEO and secretary general) (Dan) Flynn, but no one provided them to the team and no action was taken.“That same year, national team players reported to Gulati and Jill Ellis, national team head coach, that Riley ‘created a hostile environment,’ and ‘belittle(d)’ and ‘verbally abuse(d)’ players. The feedback was distributed to Flynn, Lisa Levine (NWSL general counsel) and Bailey. Bailey distributed the feedback to the Thorns’ owner and president, but no action was taken in response to those comments either.”Riley’s abuses first came to light in a report by The Athletic in October 2021, which sparked multiple investigations, including that of U.S. Soccer.Its report concludes that while the Thorns’ 2015 investigation did not address “the most serious” of Shim’s allegations — which included persistent and unwanted sexual advances and retaliation from Riley when she asked him to stop — the team’s internal investigation at the time made several conclusions before Riley’s eventual termination for cause:“That Riley sent ‘inappropriate texts,’ served alcohol to players, invited ‘a player to his hotel room,’ and danced ‘with a player and touch(ed) her while doing so,’ among other things,” the report said. “Although the (Thorns) terminated Riley, it announced publicly that it had elected not to renew his contract and thanked him for his service. The Federation and the League did not discipline Riley (whether by suspending his license or otherwise) or prevent him from coaching in the NWSL. Nor did the Federation separately inform his youth club of his conduct.”Many failures on the part of the Federation and NWSL are outlined in extensive detail in the report. But the Thorns organization’s public characterization of its own involvement in Riley’s continued employment in women’s soccer — particularly the role Wilkinson played — appears to have been misleading.“In an email to Gulati, Flynn, and Levine, (then-NWSL commissioner) (Jeff) Plush conveyed his understanding that Gavin Wilkinson (Thorns general manager) told the Flash that Riley was ‘put in a bad position by the player,’ and that Wilkinson would ‘hire (Riley) in a heartbeat.’ Although Plush, Gulati, Flynn, and Levine all had received Shim’s detailed complaint — and Plush and Levine received the 2015 Thorns report — none appeared to provide the Flash with additional information.”Ostensibly, because U.S. Soccer officials failed to convey the nature of allegations against Riley, the Flash had to rely on Wilkinson’s alleged characterization of the situation — that Shim put the coach “in a bad position.”A more recent internal examination of the situation by the Thorns, conducted earlier this year by law firm DLA Piper — the findings of which were obtained and detailed by The Oregonian/OregonLive — concluded that Wilkinson did not discuss the reason for Riley’s firing at all with the Flash because he was advised not to.U.S. Soccer’s findings fly in the face of that assertion.What’s more, the Thorns also interfered in U.S. Soccer’s investigation, the report said.“Certain teams did not fully cooperate, notwithstanding public statements to the contrary,” U.S. Soccer’s report reads. “The Portland Thorns interfered with our access to relevant witnesses and raised specious legal arguments in an attempt to impede our use of relevant documents.”U.S. Soccer concluded that teams, including the Thorns, used misleading news releases thanking coaches for their service even though they had been privately fired for “abusive misconduct.”“In addition, when contacted by teams considering hiring the departed coach, some teams compounded the obfuscation by downplaying the coach’s misconduct,” U.S. Soccer’s report said. “Even where the federation and/or the league was aware of the misconduct, it typically did nothing to correct the team’s inaccurate description or minimized the coach’s misconduct. For example, the Portland Thorns, the federation, and the league failed to ensure Riley’s conduct was accurately disclosed to Western New York Flash or North Carolina Courage.“Certain teams also cloaked information about coach misconduct in attorney-client privilege, non-disclosure agreements, and non-disparagement clauses. For example, the Portland Thorns vigorously attempted to prevent our investigation from using the 2015 Thorns report — which had been in USSF’s possession since 2015 — on the grounds that it was protected by attorney-client privilege and common-interest privilege, despite all evidence to the contrary.”UPDATE (10:43 a.m. PT): According to the investigative report, Paulson also sent an email to the president of the Flash after the club’s hiring of Riley in March 2016. “Best of luck this season and congrats on the Riley hire. I have a lot of affection for him,” Paulson wrote.”UPDATE (10:57 a.m. PT): Per the report, one Thorns player recalled that Wilkinson would jokingly ask her “why can’t you just stop being a b----” when she would ask him for something. Players also recalled “Paulson making inappropriate comments, including trying to talk with a player about Hope Solo’s nude pictures.” The Thorns “strongly deny” the allegations, per the report.UPDATE (4:34 p.m. PT): Shim, Farrelly and Erin Simon — who accused former Racing Louisville coach Christy Holly of sexual assault — shared a joint statement:“There have been too many years of inaction and too many empty promises made while players suffered at the hands of the league. No one involved has taken any responsibility for the clear role they played in harming players. — not the teams, not the league, and not the federation. They chose to ignore us and silence us, allowing the abuse to continue.“It is time for action, accountability, and change. Owners who have driven a culture of disrespect, who are complicit in abusing their own players, have no place in this league and should be removed from governance immediately. This will be the first of many necessary steps to finally hearing our voices and keeping our players safe.”Read the full U.S. Soccer report here.-- Ryan Clarke, rclarke@oregonian.com, Twitter: @RyanTClarkeIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.\n",

            "34Merritt Paulson: Portland Timbers and Thorns ownerNEW!1,388sharesBy Ryan Clarke | The Oregonian/OregonLiveFacing mounting public pressure from fans, sponsors and the Portland soccer community, Merritt Paulson announced Tuesday that he is stepping down as CEO of the Portland Timbers and Thorns effective immediately, removing himself from the operations of a club he has owned and operated since 2007.In a lengthy Tuesday morning statement revealing the news, Paulson also apologized to players, the organization and the community, saying that “our organization’s failures and mistakes were ultimately my responsibility.”“As you know, I removed myself from Thorns decision-making,” Paulson said in the statement. “Yet, in order for the organization to move forward and unite, I feel that another step is necessary. Effective immediately, I am removing myself as CEO of the Portland Thorns and Portland Timbers, and announcing a global search for a CEO of the organization.”Paulson will maintain his ownership stake in PTFC. But he will no longer be involved in day-to-day operations. A team source confirmed to The Oregonian/OregonLive that Paulson will no longer be involved in operational decisions for either club.General counsel Heather Davis will step in as interim president and CEO of both clubs, and Sarah Keane, Davis’ chief operating officer appointee, will lead the search for a permanent CEO. Davis and Keane have both committed to having Thorns and Timbers players meet their final CEO candidates, Paulson said in his statement. A team source confirmed to The Oregonian/OregonLive that Davis and Keane will be the ones making operational decisions at PTFC.Paulson’s franchise-altering move to step away from team operations comes after he fired top executives Gavin Wilkinson and Mike Golub last week, following a damning investigative report from U.S. Soccer that found Paulson and Wilkinson enabled and vouched for former Thorns coach Paul Riley, who has been accused by former players Mana Shim and Sinead Farrelly of sexual misconduct. Golub has been accused of making an inappropriate sexual remark to former Thorns coach Cindy Parlow Cone in 2013 and previously faced criticism for fomenting a “toxic” work environment for his employees.“The Portland Thorns were created to be a beacon of what is possible in women’s sports,” Paulson said in his statement. “A successful team is built on trust, equality and accountability, and today I am holding myself accountable for not doing enough. I owe Sinead and Mana, the Thorns players and the NWSL my tireless effort to actively make sure what happened in 2015 never happens again.“I apologize to our players, the organization, and the Portland community for the mistakes we made, including not being publicly transparent about Paul Riley’s termination. Our organization’s failures and mistakes were ultimately my responsibility, and my responsibility alone. It is devastating to me that my goal of creating the shining example of what a women’s sports team could be, has now become synonymous with abhorrent and predatory behavior.”Paulson said that while the future of the organization is unclear, ensuring the “long-term health and success” of the Thorns franchise — far more tenuous than that of the Timbers — is of “critical” importance to him. A sale of one or both teams is still a possibility, but Paulson did not address the issue in his statement.“While a determination has yet to be made on the future of Merritt’s ownership of the Thorns, his North Star is to ensure the franchise’s continued viability and that it remains in Portland,” a team source told The Oregonian/OregonLive.Paulson, 49, son of former Goldman Sachs CEO and U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, purchased the Timbers in 2007 and joined Major League Soccer in 2011, paying a $35 million expansion fee. The Thorns joined the NWSL as one of its founding member teams in 2013.The club, which is known as PTFC — combining the Timbers and Thorns under one business umbrella — is reportedly valued at $685 million today.Paulson’s accomplishments as owner include a transformation of Providence Park into one of the top soccer venues in the United States, the establishment of two perennial on-field contenders in the Timbers and Thorns — they have combined to win three championships — business relationships with tendrils throughout the city of Portland and beyond, and helping build and embrace Portland’s reputation as “Soccer City, USA.”Famously outspoken, brash and often intemperate on social media, Paulson gained a reputation as a new kind of professional sports owner: one whose constant accessibility often served as a double-edged sword. He could be basking in cheers as he cut off a log slab with Timber Joey’s chainsaw one day, then be sitting in hot water for calling a hyper-critical fan a “loser” on Twitter the next day. He was no stranger to calling out game officials, either, in real life and on social media.The early years of Paulson’s tenure as owner were relatively scandal-free, despite his bombastic personality. But according to the U.S. Soccer report, Paulson knew as early as 2014 that Riley was verbally abusive to players, and in 2015 the club quietly fired the Thorns coach after Shim accused Riley of sexual harassment. The reason for his firing — and that he was fired at all — was not made public until October 2021, when The Athletic reported about Shim and Farrelly’s allegations.What’s more, Paulson, Wilkinson, U.S. Soccer and the NWSL failed to convey the details of the firing to the future teams Riley would coach, the U.S. Soccer report found.Paulson continued to vouch for Riley in the years after his firing, neglecting to inform the Western New York Flash of the reasons behind Riley’s termination. In March 2016, according to the U.S. Soccer report, Paulson told the president of the Flash in an email: “Best of luck this season and congrats on the Riley hire. I have a lot of affection for him.”Meanwhile, in an open letter to fans after The Athletic’s report, Paulson called Riley “a predatory coach.”Off-field scandals plagued Paulson and the PTFC front office for the past year.In addition to the issues surrounding Riley, former Timbers player Andy Polo was accused of domestic violence by partner Genessis Alarcon in February. The Timbers terminated Polo’s contract soon after, but the club knew of previous allegations made by Alarcon and sent club representatives to the couple’s residence after an alleged incident in May 2021.The Timbers did not report the incident to the league, an action that eventually drew a $25,000 fine from MLS. Wilkinson went on to renew Polo’s contract, but claimed the club was looking to trade him. The alleged mishandling of the incident underscored fans’ frustrations with how the club handles issues when women are the victims.Front office relations with the Timbers Army and Rose City Riveters have frayed in recent years, reaching a point in which the groups regularly organize in-game protests and extended moments of silence, while sometimes even boycotting concessions. Some longtime fans canceled season tickets due to the myriad off-field scandals, although attendance at both Timbers and Thorns games has dipped only slightly.The 107 Independent Supporters Trust, Timbers Army and Rose City Riveters eventually called for Paulson to sell the clubs — after the release of the U.S. Soccer investigation — which widened an already significant gap between the club’s owner and its fans. Leadership of the fan groups said they would cut off all communication with the PTFC front office until Paulson sold both teams and fired Wilkinson and Golub. He has now done all but divest his financial interest in the teams.“As a leadership group, we were lied to,” the TA, Riveters’ and 107IST statement said hours after the release of the U.S. Soccer investigation. “Although we remained cautiously optimistic at each meeting and in each interaction with PTFC leadership, reading the report highlighted the multiple bold-faced lies we were told, both in meetings and in town halls.”As he steps away from the operations side after 15 years at the helm, Paulson has a complicated legacy initially defined by his creation and nurturing of a unique and beloved Portland sports institution, but marred by off-field scandals and a broken relationship with some of the most passionate soccer fans in the country.Read the full U.S. Soccer report here.-- Ryan Clarke, rclarke@oregonian.com, Twitter: @RyanTClarkeIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.\n",

            "The Oregon Firearms Federation’s suit was the first court challenge to the state's new voter-approved gun control measure. A second lawsuit was filed Wednesday by the Second Amendment Foundation, Firearms Policy Coalition, two firearms dealers and one gun owner.Getty ImagesNEW!By Maxine Bernstein | The Oregonian/OregonLiveOregon’s attorney general argued in court papers Wednesday that any court-ordered delay of gun control Measure 114 would result in more unnecessary deaths and forestall steps “to reduce the risk of a massacre” in the state.The recent voter-approved measure, set to take effect Dec. 8, will ban the sale, transfer or manufacture of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, require a permit to purchase a gun and only allow a gun to be sold or transferred once a criminal background check is completed.The new regulations, narrowly approved by 50.7% of voters, are designed to reduce mass shootings, suicides and homicides.The Oregon Firearms Federation, joined by three county sheriffs and two gun store owners in Keizer and Pendleton, last week filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction to bar Measure 114 from becoming law, arguing its requirements violate their Second Amendment right to bear arms, as well as their due process rights.The federation’s suit was the first court challenge to Oregon’s new gun control measure. A second lawsuit was filed Wednesday by the Second Amendment Foundation, Firearms Policy Coalition, two firearms dealers and one gun owner.U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut has scheduled a hearing at 10 a.m. Friday on the firearms federation’s emergency motion, six days before the measure is scheduled to go into effect.The gun owners and three sheriffs have argued that magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are commonly used for self-defense, and without them, law-abiding gun owners will be at a tactical disadvantage when confronting criminals.The attorney general’s office, in its response, argued large-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are not “arms” protected by the Second Amendment and the state’s new requirement for a permit to purchase a gun will withstand constitutional scrutiny.In a 42-page court filing Wednesday, a senior assistant attorney general wrote that any move to put the measure on hold while litigation proceeds would likely result in a rush of people buying “tens of thousands” of more guns and ammunition before the regulations could take hold and endanger public safety.A stampede to buy guns has already occurred.Before Nov. 8, the state police averaged 849 background check requests a day for new gun purchases. Since then, the daily average has quadrupled to 4,092, the attorney general’s filing says.The attorney general’s office argues that the current gun owners who have filed a lawsuit challenging the measure won’t be harmed if the measure becomes law.“Plaintiffs can continue to keep and bear the arms they currently possess, which is enough to protect their Second Amendment rights for the pendency of this litigation,” wrote Brian Simmonds Marshall, a senior assistant attorney general.The legal landscape has changed since the measure was drafted.In June, the U.S. Supreme Court set a new legal standard for evaluating Second Amendment claims. In a 6-3 ruling in June, the nation’s high court struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home. The court’s majority directed lower courts to use a new “text-and-history” standard when evaluating challenges to firearms regulations.Courts must determine whether “the Second Amendment’s plain text” protects the conduct in which the plaintiff wishes to engage, and if it does, then decide if the regulation “is consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”The firearms federation and other plaintiffs challenging the measure say that restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines are not part of any “historic tradition.”They further argue that the magazine capacity restriction amounts to the “physical taking of property without compensation,” and is therefore unconstitutional.A nonprofit called the Silent Majority Foundation, which advocates for individual liberty and wants to serve as a friend of the court in support of the firearms federation’s legal challenge, argued in a new legal filing Wednesday that magazines of more than ten rounds “are older than the United States.”“The first American presence of such firearms occurred, fittingly in Oregon, with a firearm that included a twenty-two round magazine as Meriwether Lewis carried a Girandoni air rifle on his famous expedition with William Clark and the Corps of Discovery in 1804-06,” its filing said.The attorney general’s office is confident the restrictions on large-capacity magazines will withstand the new standard set by the U.S. Supreme Court in the New York case.“Large-capacity magazines are also analogous to dangerous weapons that have historically been restricted without infringing on the core right of self-defense,” Marshall wrote.He noted that 12 other states and the District of Columbia have enacted similar laws restricting large-capacity magazines.Further, the office argues, there’s no historical precedent to compare to today’s gun violence epidemic.Mass shootings by a single individual that resulted in 10 or more deaths were unknown in U.S. history until 1949 and rare until 2007, according to the filing by the attorney general’s office.“Every mass shooting since 2004 that resulted in 14 or more deaths involved large-capacity magazines. The use of large-capacity magazines to perpetrate mass shootings has no precedent in the founding or reconstruction eras,” Marshall wrote. The social concern of massacres perpetrated by single shooters has no precedent in 1791 or even in 1868.”Ryan Busse, a former senior executive in the firearms industry who is now senior advisor to Giffords, the gun safety organization led by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, filed a brief with the court in support of the Oregon attorney general’s stance. He also wrote a book called, “Gunfight: My Battle Against the Industry that Radicalized America.”He wrote that large-capacity magazines “are not necessary for the basic intended use of firearms. Further, in my experience large-capacity magazines are not necessary to effectively deploy guns for self-defense or sporting purposes like hunting.’’ He also said that most handguns and AR-15 style rifles can accept and fully function with a magazine that holds 10 or fewer rounds.The attorney general’s office also challenged the plaintiffs’ allegations that the measure violates their due process rights.People who already own magazines that hold more than 10 rounds can retain them and continue to keep and use them as long as they do so on their property or for sport shooting, shooting competitions or hunting, within the law’s restrictions.Measure 114 does not retroactively prohibit the possession of lawfully acquired large-capacity magazines, the attorney general’s office noted.“The law does not punish past purchases, only future conduct,” Marshall wrote. “Legislation readjusting rights and burdens of such ownership is not unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise settled expectations.’’The attorney general’s office also defended the permit-to-purchase gun program. It contends the nation’s high court ruling in the New York case “expressly allows states” to adopt programs in which applicants are required to undergo a background check, pass a firearms safety course, and undergo fingerprinting before getting a license or permit, as required under Measure 114.“None of the Plaintiffs have applied for a permit. Nor have Plaintiffs offered any reason to think that one or more of them would be denied a permit under Measure 114 in violation of the Second Amendment. And if they were denied a permit, or one was not approved after 30 days, they could seek speedy review in the Oregon courts,” Marshall wrote.The attorney general’s office did not address what steps the state police or local law enforcement are taking to put a permit-to-purchase program in place by Dec. 8. Several county sheriffs in the state have vowed not to enforce the measure’s magazine restrictions.Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner, president of the Oregon Association of Chiefs of Police, said the association invited chiefs to a Zoom meeting on Nov. 22 to discuss what’s needed for local police agencies to process applications to buy guns. The measure says local law enforcement would handle applications, and it’s unclear whether county sheriffs or local police would take that role, he said.“This is new for us,” he said. “Unfortunately, in this case, we have more questions unanswered and a lot of unknowns.” The association has forwarded its questions to the Oregon Department of Justice to try to get some guidance and clarity, he said.Questions regarding whether Oregon State Police has created a uniform permit application and what would constitute law enforcement-approved firearms training that someone applying for a permit would be required to complete remain unanswered, he said.Typically, the chiefs or sheriffs are consulted by lawmakers who consider public safety-related legislation, Skinner said. With the voter-approved measure, “we were not consulted at all to answer these questions on the front end. It’s a little frustrating.”The second legal challenge filed Wednesday came from the Washington-based Second Amendment Foundation, the Firearms Policy Coalition, a Clackamas County gun owner and two gun dealers from Douglas County and Washington County. It largely challenges the measure’s restrictions on large-capacity magazines and seeks a similar court-ordered injunction.Their complaint argues that many of the most popular handguns and rifles are made with magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.They allege that the measure’s restrictions will not accomplish what its proponents want it to do.\" All it will do is leave law-abiding citizens more vulnerable to attack from better-armed and more ruthless assailants,” attorney James L. Buchal wrote, on behalf of the Second Amendment Foundation and its fellow plaintiffs. “Given the hundreds of millions of magazines in circulation in the country (including in Oregon, where they remain widely possessed), it will not be difficult for violent criminals to acquire them through illegal sales or importation despite Oregon’s ban.’’-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Our journalism needs your support.

            "NEW!203sharesBy The Oregonian/OregonLive.comAfter Oregon voters narrowly passed Oregon Ballot Measure 114, one of the strictest gun laws in the country, several elected sheriffs spoke out on the new requirements for permits and the ban on large capacity magazines.Many posted letters to social media with similar talking points or shared the letter released Nov. 17 by the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association, which said, “OSSA understands that Oregonians have strong opinions on this measure, and many ... believe that it is a violation of their Second Amendment rights.”Sheriff Brad Lohrey of Sherman County joined the first legal challenge filed against Measure 114. The federal lawsuit, filed last Friday, seeks a court-ordered injunction that would bar the measure from becoming law and a court ruling that Measure 114 is unconstitutional. If a judge isn’t inclined to prevent the entire measure from taking effect, the plaintiffs ask that the court in the alternative at least bar the restriction on gun magazine capacity. The plaintiffs are the Oregon Firearms Federal, Lohrey and Adam Johnson, who owns Coat of Arms Custom Firearms in Keizer.On Wednesday, the same plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to stop the measure from going into effect Dec. 8. No hearing has been set on their request.Baker County: Sheriff Travis Ash said, “The Baker County Sheriff’s Office will not focus investigations on magazine capacity issues” and would work with partners on a permitting system.Clatsop County: Sheriff Matthew D. Phillips posted a letter in October in which he wrote about Measure 114 and said, “Infringing upon constitutional rights is not the path to the change sought.”Crook County: Sheriff John Gautney says he thinks it is unconstitutional, that it places a huge burden on his strapped staff and Measure 114 violations will “be handled with discretion.”Deschutes County: Sheriff L. Shane Nelson posted on Facebook that he thought Measure 114 would fail constitutional muster and “given our limited law enforcement resources, our response to violations of measure 114 will not be a priority for our office.”Douglas County: Sheriff John Hanlin posted that he believes the measure will be found unconstitutional, that he disagrees with it, but that nevertheless he swore to uphold the law. He said violations would be a low priority for him as he worked to develop the required permitting system.Gilliam County: The sheriff’s office Facebook page shared a video of Deschutes County Sheriff Nelson voicing his concerns in his capacity as president of the Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association.Harney County: Sheriff Daniel Jenkins posted that the “best case scenario” would be for the measure to be found unconstitutional (he posted a second message when the effective date of the measure was clarified to Dec. 8).Jackson County: Sheriff Nate Sickler assured residents his office “will work diligently to ensure people have the ability to get a permit needed to purchase a firearm, as that is a constitutional right. “ He also said, “We will not spend time and resources investigating who has obtained magazines that have a capacity over 10 rounds after this measure takes effect.”Jefferson County: Sheriff Jason Pollock told The Bulletin in Bend that violations of Measure 114 would not be a priority for his office. He posted on Facebook that for too long “a fraction of Oregon counties has exerted far too much control over rural Oregon.”Josephine County: Sheriff Dave Daniel said his county had a charter that precluded him from pursuing Measure 114 violations regarding high capacity magazines and that the Board of Commissioners had reinforced that by declaring Josephine a “Second Amendment Sanctuary County.”Klamath County: Sheriff Chris Kaber released a statement before the election result was clear Nov. 9 that said he was relying on advice of the Oregon State Sheriffs Association, which believes Measure 114 to be unconstitutional.Lincoln County: Sheriff Curtis Landers said he had opposed the measure and assured residents he would not be going “door to door” seeking out high capacity magazines. He said he would uphold the law, as is his sworn duty, if it was ruled constitutional. (His office later posted the Dec. 8 update as well.)Linn County: Sheriff Michelle Duncan said, “I want to send a clear message to Linn County residents that the Linn County Sheriff’s Office is NOT going to be enforcing magazine capacity limits.”Marion County: Sheriff Joe Kast said his office was preparing to help residents legally purchase firearms as court challenges played out and would not be prioritizing violations of the magazine capacity provisions.Morrow County: Sheriff John Bowles said he would not place an enforcement priority on high capacity magazines and would not be “knocking on doors” to check on residents’ guns.Polk County: Sheriff Mark Garton posted, “First, let me say there are still more questions that simply don’t have answers yet, which I totally understand can cause uncertainty and angst for some, including myself.” He reposted the OSSA letter.Sherman County: Sheriff Brad Lohrey joined the first legal challenge filed against Measure 114.Tillamook County: Sheriff Joshua Brown said, “I am unable to speak to the exact process that citizens will have to go through in order to obtain a permit to legally purchase a firearm in Oregon — along with other new restrictions that are spelled out in the Measure.” He said he opposed the measure and would await the outcome of court challenges.Umatilla County: The Facebook page of Sheriff Terry Rowan reposted the Deschutes County sheriff’s video (above, under Gilliam County) and said he agreed with the sentiments expressed.Union County: Sheriff Cody Bowen agreed with Linn County sheriff Duncan, saying, “This is an infringement on our constitutional rights and will not be enforced by my office!”Wallowa County: Sheriff Joel Fish told the Wallowa County Chieftain he would not enforce some provisions.Yamhill County: Sheriff Tim Svenson said his office would work to help law-abiding citizens comply with the new process and obtain guns and he would not make the high capacity magazine limits a priority. His deputies will have discretion depending on the “circumstances of the encounter.”If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.\n",

            "No date for a court hearing has been set yet.Jake MayNEW!971sharesBy Maxine Bernstein | The Oregonian/OregonLiveThe Oregon Firearms Federation, along with the Sherman County sheriff and a Keizer gun store owner, late Wednesday night filed an emergency motion seeking to bar Oregon’s gun control Measure 114 from taking effect Dec. 8.On Thursday morning, U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut scheduled a hearing on the motion for Dec. 2, six days before the measure is scheduled to take effect.The firearm federation’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction follows less than a week after the three plaintiffs filed their initial lawsuit in federal court, arguing the measure is unconstitutional.They contend the measure, which bans the sale, transfer or purchase of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds and requires a permit to purchase a gun, violates the Second Amendment right to bear arms.“Its draconian terms turn the Second Amendment on its head by stating that, instead of adults presumptively having a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, they do not have that right unless they can affirmatively prove to the government that they are ‘good enough’ to have a gun,” Attorney John Kaempf wrote in the motion.Oregon voters narrowly approved the measure following a grassroots campaign by the interfaith group Lift Every Voice Oregon.The proponents argue that the ban on large-capacity magazines will help reduce mass shootings and save lives as shooters would have to pause to reload before firing dozens of shots.James Alan Fox, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University in Boston who tracks mass killings, said there have been 13 mass killings resulting in four or more deaths since Oct. 3., and a total of 35 so far this year, making 2022 a record year for mass killings. The Gun Violence Archive, which tracks mass shootings that result in at least four people shot, injured or killed, has identified 612 so far this year.Measure 114′s permit-to-purchase gun program, its proponents argue, also will help prevent suicides because people may be thwarted from immediately getting their hands on a gun to take their own life.Those bringing the court challenge wrote in their emergency motion that the measure should be renamed the “Gun Magazine Confiscation and Gun Registry Act,” saying it won’t reduce crime but will hamper law-abiding gun owners from using common gun magazines for their own self-defense. They contend magazines that hold more than 10 rounds have existed before the American Revolution and have been commonly possessed since 1862.Kevin Starrett, president of the firearms federation, Sherman County Sheriff Brad Lohrey and Adam Johnson, owner of Coat of Arms Custom Firearms store, each submitted very similar signed declarations in support.They each argue that law-abiding gun owners will be at a disadvantage if they can’t use a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds to defend themselves in a sudden, unexpected crime because the gun owners likely won’t have more than a single gun within their reach.“The presence of multiple attackers may require far more defensive discharges to eliminate the threat. The stress of a criminal attack greatly reduces the likelihood that shots fired will hit an attacker, and bullet-hits do not necessarily incapacitate a criminal before he can complete his attack,” Starrett’s declaration said.The suit was filed against Gov. Kate Brown and Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum in U.S. District Court in Pendleton but was moved by the court to Portland and assigned to Immergut.Brian Simmonds Marshall, one of Rosenblum’s senior assistant attorney generals, has filed a notice he will represent the governor and attorney general but hasn’t yet filed an answer in response. The attorney general’s office has said it will defend the measure and assist agencies, such as state police, in putting the gun control changes into place.Meanwhile, the firearms federation predicts the court challenge will be the “single most expensive battle in the history” of its organization and sent an email to supporters urging donations for its legal bills.State police have released few details on how the new permit-to-purchase gun program will work or provided much guidance to gun owners on the steps they should take should they already own a higher-capacity magazine.Under Measure 114, licensed dealers who already own larger-capacity magazines have 180 days from the day the measure takes effect to sell them to an out-of-state gun dealer or other person out of state or to destroy them. After the 180 days, gun dealers can sell or transfer only newly manufactured high-capacity magazines marked with a special stamp denoting they’re for military or law enforcement use – two exceptions under the law.People who already own the magazines can keep them in a private home or on private property, use them at a shooting range or in a shooting competition, or for recreational purposes such as hunting as allowed by state law. A violation would be a class A misdemeanor.To prove a gun owner had possession of higher-capacity magazines prior to Measure 114 going into effect , the owner could take a photo with a timestamp of the magazines, state police Capt. Stephanie Bigman suggested. But the state police, she said, is still seeking further guidance from the agency’s legal counsel.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter @maxoregonianOur journalism needs your support.

            "Multnomah County commissioners are scheduled to hold a public hearing Monday night on their proposal to ban flavored tobacco products in the county to reduce teens' tobacco use. This 2019 file photo shows flavored vaping solutions in a window display at a vape and smoke shop in New York. APNEW!By Hillary Borrud | The Oregonian/OregonLiveMultnomah County commissioners took public input Monday night on their proposal to ban flavored tobacco products that could come up for a vote on Thursday morning.Supporters of banning flavored vapes argued that the products are getting a new generation of teenagers and preteens addicted to nicotine, that flavored vapes are omnipresent in secondary schools, even though they’re illegal for anyone under 21, and that vaping products are more hazardous than manufacturers want people to believe.Opponents of banning flavored tobacco told commissioners that a ban would fuel black market trade, undermine the ability of smokers to reduce their reliance on cigarettes and hurt retailers who sell flavored tobacco including hookah businesses.County commissioners are pushing ahead with their proposal, despite a Washington County Circuit judge’s ruling earlier this fall that Washington County could not enforce a similar ban. Circuit Judge Andrew Erwin asserted that such a ban must come from the state.Multnomah County commissioners will not vote on the proposal until its next meeting at 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 1. People can still submit written comments online and text of the proposed ordinance is available on the county’s website.Health advocates, teenagers and parents have been pushing for years for the state to restrict sales of flavored vaping liquids and other tobacco products that appeal to youth, and Multnomah County officials are also concerned that tobacco manufacturers are targeting the products to people of color. But Democratic lawmakers killed a proposal to ban flavored vapes in 2019, and a Democratic senator who backed the statewide ban told The Oregonian/OregonLive that lobbyists for the Oregon Nurses Association and the political arm of the American Cancer Society pushed lawmakers to drop the flavored tobacco ban and instead focus on supporting a push to raise Oregon’s tobacco tax. Voters approved the tobacco tax hike in 2020.A law passed by the Democratically controlled Legislature in 2021 is at issue in Washington County’s attempt to ban flavored tobacco products. The circuit court judge who ruled against the county on the ban cited Senate Bill 587, the 2021 law that gave public health agencies the authority to regulate tobacco sales, as the reason that only the state could ban flavored vapes.Supporters of such bans, including American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, have said the Washington County judge’s ruling was wrong and does not prevent Multnomah County from adopting its own local prohibition on flavored tobacco.During the hearing on Monday night, multiple physicians testified in support of the proposed ban. Pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Hoffman of Oregon Health & Science University said there is “no coincidence” that manufacturers offer vaping flavors like banana split, blueberry cake, Skittles, Curious George and Smurf. Hoffman said those flavors are aimed at hooking kids on tobacco. A pulmonologist testified about the destructive effects of vaping that she observed on a young patient’s lungs. And Dr. Phillip Gardiner, co-chair of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, cited the disproportionate impacts of flavored tobacco use among Black people but also women, Latinos and other groups as reasons to support a ban.A couple of people, including an employee of Portland Public Schools who works on substance use, also pointed out that vape use is so rampant in schools that some have had to remove doors of bathroom stalls to discourage it and the fruity smell of flavored vapes often fills school hallways.At the same time, the owner of several tobacco products stores questioned why county commissioners are considering banning only flavored tobacco when other addictive products — such as flavored liquor and cannabis — are not being considered for a ban, although they also appeal to young users.— Hillary Borrud; hborrud@oregonian.comOur journalism needs your support.

Hurley was found unresponsive in his cell Nov. 19, two days after deputies booked him for a parole violation, according to jail records. Deputies and health staff tried to revive Hurley, the sheriff’s office said. He was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.The sheriff’s office has released few details on Hurley’s death, writing in a press release only that the medical examiner’s autopsy did not reveal evidence of homicide. The official cause and manner of death is pending, in a process the sheriff’s office said could take “several weeks to months” due to a backlog at the state crime lab.The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office has not responded to an inquiry from The Oregonian/OregonLive seeking further information about Hurley’s death. Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office detectives are conducting a death investigation, the agency said.At least two other people have died in custody at the downtown jail this year. Jess Rivas-Castillo, a 36-year-old man, died May 9 of acute cocaine poisoning, the medical examiner ruled.On July 26, Stephen Wayne Murphy, 63, was found unresponsive and not breathing in his cell. He was taken to a local hospital where he died later that night. Murphy was booked into the Multnomah County Detention Center on federal drug charges in March, when he declared during the booking process he had significant medical issues. The sheriff’s office said he received ongoing medical care while in custody.

            "FILEFile artNEW!By Zane Sparling | The Oregonian/OregonLiveA former student at Woodburn High School sued the district Monday after its former head football coach was convicted of sexually abusing her when she was 17.Nicholas Federico, now 41, was sentenced Nov. 15 to 2½ years in state prison and must register as a sex offender after a jury convicted him of second-degree sexual abuse and luring a minor during the 2017-2018 school year.The suit filed in Marion County Circuit Court seeks $3 million in damages for the student’s pain and suffering, alleging that the district failed to prevent the sexual abuse, some of which occurred in Federico’s office and in his truck while it was parked at a middle school campus.“She’s held Mr. Frederico accountable,” said Barbara Long, the student’s attorney. “And now she wants to hold the school district accountable.”Woodburn School District spokesperson Rachel Danskey declined to comment on the pending litigation.Federico taught the student’s freshman and sophomore weightlifting classes, then posed as a “confidant and teacher she could trust” after the student became pregnant and asked if she could volunteer with the coach to raise her grades before graduation, according to the lawsuit.He provided the student with his personal cell number and began sending explicit messages, according to the lawsuit and records in the criminal case. The sexual abuse began at Federico’s home on prom night when his wife was out of town, the student testified during the jury trial.They continued to meet after the student turned 18, but contact ceased in July 2019, Federico’s defense attorney, Zachary Stern, wrote in court filings in the criminal case.The coach eventually paid the student $20,000, but balked after the victim demanded an additional $10,000, the defense attorney argued. The student then sent intimate images of Federico to his family members, according to Stern, who didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.Authorities later recovered “love letters” from other students in Federico’s desk during an investigation, according to court records. Federico’s mother was one of the top administrators at the high school.The criminal case turned political last month after a prosecutor pushed Marion County Circuit Judge Erious Johnson, who was up for election Nov. 8, to determine Federico’s punishment before voters marked their ballots. Johnson ultimately sentenced Federico after losing the election.Court records say Federico had been provisionally licensed as a physical education teacher in Oregon since 2010, though a copy of his certification was not available in a state database. Court records indicate the licensure was set to expire in 2022.Long said the former student is now focused on parenting and taking college classes.“When Mr. Federico targeted and groomed her, she was at a very vulnerable point in her life. She was isolated,” Long said. “But she truly has taken steps to improve life for herself and for her daughter.”— Zane Sparling; zsparling@oregonian.com; 503-319-7083; @pdxzaneOur journalism needs your support.
